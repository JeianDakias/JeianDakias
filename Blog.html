                <h1>Introduction To Computing</h1>
                <p>Intro to Computing teaches fundamental computer science and information technology concepts.
                     Students explore basics like computer systems, hardware, software, networking, and 
                     computing's societal impact. The course cultivates problem solving skills and logical 
                     thinking, laying the foundation for advanced computing studies. Professions and careers in
                      computing provide a variety of options, including jobs like software developer, 
                      network engineer, data scientist, cybersecurity analyst, systems analyst, database 
                      administrator, and IT project manager.</p>

                <h4>Unit 2</h4>
                 <h1>How Computers Work</h1>
                <p>The information processing cycle is a series of steps that a computer follows to receive, 
                    process, store, and output data. These steps are: input (data entry), processing 
                    (performing calculations and tasks), storage (saving data for future use), and output 
                    (presenting the processed information). This cycle is continuous and forms the basis 
                    for all computer operations.</p>

                <h4>Unit 3</h4>
                <h1>Basic Concept Of Computer Security</h1>
                <p>The basic concept of computer security is to protect computer systems and data from 
                    unauthorized access, harm, or theft, making sure that information stays confidential,
                     remains intact, and is always available when needed.</p>

                <h1>The Internet</h1>
                <p>Cybersecurity acts like a set of traffic rules and security measures to ensure the safe and
                     reliable flow of information on this digital highway. The World Wide Web, then, is like 
                     the bustling city built along these highways, where users navigate through interconnected
                      streets (web pages) to access information, and cybersecurity serves as the city's 
                      security system, protecting against potential threats and ensuring a safe online
                       experience for everyone.</p>

                <h4>Unit 5</h4>
                <h1>Web Development</h1>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) forms the structure of a web page, defining elements like
                     text, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) complements HTML by styling and 
                     designing these elements, enhancing the visual presentation and user experience of a 
                     website. Together, they are fundamental tools in web development, creating well-structured
                      and visually appealing web pages.</p>

    <h1>My favorite lesson that challenged me the most is web development. Learning html/css
        requires a lot of patience and it is very time consuming. So far learning html/css is
        fun as i get to discover more things about it.
